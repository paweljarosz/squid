## Defold dependency:

You can add Squid as a dependency to Defold. Open your `game.project` file and add the following link as an entry in the `Dependencies` under the `Project` section. Current version is 1.0: 

`https://github.com/paweljarosz/squid/archive/refs/tags/1.0.zip`

Squid uses also immutable configuration, so add dependency to newest Immutable too. Current is 1.1:

`https://github.com/paweljarosz/lua-immutable/archive/refs/tags/v1.1.zip`

## Usage:

Squid offers simple static API, check examples:

```lua
	-- If squid is initialized with init() it will handle errors and crashes automatically too
	squid.init()

	-- Define new tag strings and enable/disable them:
	squid.set_allowed("main", true)

	-- Use static logging functions with or without optional non-string data and/or tag string:
	squid.trace("My Trace Message")								-- no data and no tag, uses default tag ("none")
	squid.debug("My Debug Message  ", { my_test_data = 1 })		-- with optional non-string data (default tag used)
	squid.info( "My Info Message   ", "main")					-- with string data only (used as tag too)
	squid.warn( "My Warning Message", "Hello World", "main")	-- with string data and tag ("main" tag is used as tag here)
	squid.error("My Error Message  ", vmath.vector3(1), "main")	-- with non-string data and tag

	-- Or generic logging function with own logging level:
	squid.log("My Other Message", squid.DEBUG)

    -- You can explicitly save any unsaved buffered logs to a file at any time:
	--(logs are saved automatically anyway, in batch, every X logs if configured in game.project)
	squid.save_logs()

	-- If squid.final() is called (in final() preferably) it checks for crash dumps and saves all unsaved buffered logs
	squid.final()
```

### Instancing

Squid can be conveniently used as internal logger module for various other Defold modules, e.g.:
* [Pigeon](https://github.com/paweljarosz/pigeon) by Pawe≈Ç Jarosz
* [Defold Saver](https://github.com/Insality/defold-saver) by Insality
* [Defold Event](https://github.com/Insality/defold-event) by Insality

```lua
	-- Create new instance with optional tag assigned (`none` by default) initially allowed or not:
	local is_allowed = true
	self.player_logger = squid.new("player", is_allowed)

	-- Use all API function with the created instance:
	self.player_logger:info("Logger with 'player' tag")
```

Above prints in console and writes to a log file:
```lua
TRACE:  [none]: [16:05:06] main/main.script:13: My Trace Message
DEBUG:  [none]: [16:05:06] main/main.script:14: My Debug Message  
 Data:
  {
    my_test_data = 1,
  }
INFO:   [main]: [16:05:06] main/main.script:15: My Info Message   
WARNING:[main]: [16:05:06] main/main.script:16: My Warning Message
ERROR:  [main]: [16:05:06] main/main.script:17: My Error Message  
 Data: vmath.vector3(1, 1, 1)
DEBUG:  [none]: [16:05:06] main/main.script:19: My Other Message
```

Additionally, the different log level messages are colored in Defold console:

### Configuration

Squid can be configured in Defold's `game.project` file. Add squid configuration at the end of the file:

```
[squid]
app_catalog = squid_app_catalog
log_file_name = squid_log_file
log_file_extension = log
is_enabled = 1
is_enabled_in_release = 1
is_printing = 1
is_saving = 1
is_adding_timestamp = 1
is_using_allowlist = 1
days_to_delete_logs = 7
min_log_level = 1
unsaved_logs_buffer = 30
max_log_length = 50
max_data_depth = 5
```

### Thanks

Squid is heavily inspired by [Log](https://github.com/subsoap/log) and [Err](https://github.com/subsoap/err) by Subsoap and [Defold Log](https://github.com/Insality/defold-log) by Insality and uses and iterates over some of their solutions. Squid tries to be compatible with both APIs for easier replacements.
